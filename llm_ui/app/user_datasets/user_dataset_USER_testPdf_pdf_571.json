These vesicles are separated from the membrane and transported to distinct destinations. Some vesicles return to the apical membrane, while others are guided to the basolateral side, where they join and expel their\n...\nsame time, there are additional barrier systems to keep the brain against lipid-soluble compounds that are potentially harm- ful and can permeate directly out of the vessels walls. These barriers are called e\ufb04ux pumps which attach to molecules and carry them into the bloodstream out of the cerebral tissue [67].\n...\n[73] W.

            "assay_by_molecule_14": "Occludin is a membrane protein that is found at the TJs. Its levels in the serum of individuals with brain disorders are signi\ufb01cantly greater than those healthy, suggesting that occludin might be utilized as a biomarker to evaluate the risk of brain disorders and BBB dysfunction [93]. Even though it is currently in the experimental stage, it has a considerable chance of being utilized in diagnostics in the future [92].\n...\nA biomarker that may indicate BBB disruption should have including high sensitivity, speci\ufb01city, numerous features, and reliability, as well as quick and easy evaluation. The ini- tial stage in BBB breakdown is a degradation of structural proteins. The degraded proteins are discharged into the bloodstream once the BBB is damaged. As a result, asses- sing BBB structural proteins in the blood may be a reliable indicator of BBB impairment [92].

MMP 9 is known to be linked to the breakdown of the BBB. According to several studies, MMP 9 is implicated in the breakdown of type IV collagen, layer proteins, and \ufb01brin, all of them are important elements of the basal lamina [95]. In scienti\ufb01c research, MMP 9 level has been linked to BBB injury, sug- gesting that MMP 9 might be used as a biomarker to predict brain disruption [96].\n...\npathway depends on leukocytes to pass the BBB.

Because of the limited in\ufb01ltration of immune cells into the brain relative to other tissues and the tightly controlled immune cell-BBB relationship, the CNS is considered an immune-advantaged region.
