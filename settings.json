Here we analyze the whole exomes and transcriptomes of 187 primary tumors from a Korean BC cohort (SMC) enriched in pre-menopausal patients and perform systematic comparison with a primarily Caucasian and post-menopausal BC cohort (TCGA). SMC harbors higher proportions of HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes, lower proportion of Luminal A with decreased ESR1 expression compared to TCGA. We also observe increased mutation prevalence affecting BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 in SMC with an enrichment of a mutation signature linked to homologous recombination repair deficiency in TNBC. Finally, virtual microdissection and multivariate analyses reveal that Korean BC status is independently associated with increased TIL and decreased TGF-\u03b2 signaling expression signatures, suggesting that younger Asian BCs harbor more immune-active microenvironment than western BCs.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the cancer type discussed in the paper?\n\nYour answer: Breast cancer\n(END OF EXAMPLE)\n\nACTUAL TASK:\nTitle:\n{title}\n\nAbstract:\n{abstract}\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nYour answer: ", "model": "llama3.1I-8b-q4", "use_openai": false, "similarity_k": 5, "profiler_options": {"field_info_to_compare": "choices"}}
